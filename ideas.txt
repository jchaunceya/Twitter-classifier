How do we (semi) accurately determine 
what do we want to know?
     that a recruiting event HAPPENED at a high school
     	  not discussion
	  modals / imperatives 

how do we determine whether text describes a current event or past?
    training data of current events
    training data of past events?
    	     classify into current and past events

	     easy - binomial classifier
	     	  past
		  present
	     hard - multinomial       
	     	  simple past
		  simple present
	     	  mixed - how do we extract what we need to know?

Classification is supervised learning 
	       observations are analyzed into a set of quantifiable properties
