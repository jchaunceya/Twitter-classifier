How do we (semi) accurately determine 
what do we want to know?
     that a recruiting event HAPPENED at a high school
     	  not discussion
	  modals / imperatives 

how do we determine whether text describes a current event or past?
    training data of current events
    training data of past events?
    	     classify into current and past events

	     easy - binomial classifier
	     	  past
		  present
	     hard - multinomial       
	     	  simple past
		  simple present
	     	  mixed - how do we extract what we need to know?

Classification is supervised learning 
	       observations are analyzed into a set of quantifiable properties
	       
Feature vectors:	

	["past", "present"]
	["low-income", "medium-income", "high-income"]
	["university", "college", "community college"]

information:

	date
	university
	nature of event?

Data we can actually collect from tweets:
     text
     user -> their tweets,location,all json info -> their follows/followers
     location
     time 
     retweeted_status

MySQL : storing tweets?

      text,usr,location,time,university ... 

MySQL:

      CREATE DATABASE tweets
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS( 
      	     id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	     ...
